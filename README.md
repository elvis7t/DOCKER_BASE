# Web Development Environment with Docker

##PHP 
##APACHE
##MYSQL
##PHPMYADMIN

With this environment it is possible to access a web service such as a website, for example, with a persistent Mysql database and access to the mysql graphical interface

## To access the environment follow the steps below:

1ยบ clone the repository in your folder
```
 git clone https://github.com/elvis7t/DOCKER_BASE.git
```
2ยบ Inside the DOCKER_BASE folder run the command 
```
docker-compose up -d
``` 
3ยบ Access the containers

 php-container
 - http://localhost:85/view/index.php

 phpmyadmin(Mysql Interface)
 - http://localhost:8080/index.php
   
    Login :
    Server: msql    
    User: db_user    
    Password: db_pass
    
 ## Database
Change the following files:
* db/migrations/init-database.sh change the name of the bank that is like "useacabeca";
* docker-compose.yaml line 24;
  
In order for your ready-made database to be exported and instantiated:
In the db/migrations/001-create-database.sql folder I suggest exporting the already created database to a .sql file, then change its name to 001-create-tables.sql and replace it in the folder.

Remove the containers and delete the db/data folder before running 
```
docker-compose up -d 
```
## Folder with your web system
The system folder if changed to one containing html, php etc files..
it is necessary to change in 2 places, because this name is the reference, so change it in:    
 * DOCKERFILE line 3
 * docker-compose.yaml line 12
